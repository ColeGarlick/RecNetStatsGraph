# RecNetStatsGraph
A simple Javascript Userscript to inject some fancy code into your page that will take your internal API data and gather you an accurate donut chart of your earnings distribution by type as well as showing you your best selling key, consumable, and currency!

# Example:

# How it works:
To use this script, you will need to be using either Google Chrome or Mozzila Firefox. Or any browser that supports the extension named `Tampermoney`.
- [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/ "Tampermonkey for Firefox")
- [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en "Tampermonkey for Chrome")

From there, you'll simply create a new userscript.
